# Rails Lab in Groups

## Discuss

Answer these questions to the satisfaction of everyone in the group:

* Rails favors **convention** over **configuration**, what do you think this means?

* The way we have learned migrations, there is an intermediate step between generating a migration and running that migration. What is it and why does that step exist?

* What does running a migration do?

* What is a foreign key used for?

* What is ActiveRecord exactly?
