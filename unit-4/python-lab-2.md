## Fizzbuzz Lab 1 Part 1

Fizzbuzz is often used as a basic way to root out job candidates - often before they ever even reach an interview! So it's to your advantage to be able to do this problem really well!

### Prerequesites

* Writing a function in python
* Using parameters/arguments in python functions
* Writing a loop in python
* Writing conditional statements in python
* Using modulus
* Using print to output text

### Prompt

Write a function called `fizzbuzz` that has a parameter `n`. `fizzbuzz` takes a numerical argument for the value of `n`, which is the maximum value to print up to. For example, if I gave you the number 10, I would expect your program to start at 1 and print up to 10.

Additionally, your function should do the following:

* If a number is divisible by 3, print `fizz`
* If a number is divisible by 5, print `buzz`
* If a number is divisible by 3 AND 5, print `fizzbuzz`
* If none of the above are true, just print the number itself

### Example Usage

```python
fizzbuzz(20)
```

### Expected Output

```text
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
16
17
fizz
19
buzz
```

### Python Frameworks

Look up 3 Python Frameworks and write a paragraph about each one.

### Interpreted/ Compiled Languages

Look up the difference between an Interpreted Language and a Compiled Language and write a paragraph about each one. Find three examples of each type of language and list them. Write whether Python is Compiled or Interpreted.

### Selenium/ Chromedriver

Look up Selenium and Chromedriver, and write a paragraph about what they are used for/ what they do.

### Object Methods

Look up what object methods are and write a paragraph about them.

### Global Keyword

Look up the global keyword in Python and write a paragraph about what it does

### List Comprehension

Look up list comprehension and write a paragraph about what it does.

### Language Levels

Look up what a High Level language is and write a paragraph about it. Is Python a high level language? Also look up what low level languages are and write about them as well.

### Built in Python Functions

Go to this link, [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html), and find three functions that we haven't gone over yet. Write them down and explain what they do.

### Immutable/ Mutable Objects

What two types of object are immutable in Python?

What are the three that are?
