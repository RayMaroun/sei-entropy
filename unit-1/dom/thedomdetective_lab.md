# Lab: The Dom Detective

## DOM Detective

Open up [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/) in Chrome, and open up the JavaScript console `CMD + Option + J` on **Mac,** `Ctrl + Shift + I` on **Windows**.

Use DOM access methods \(e.g. **`document.querySelector`**\) to find the following parts of the page. You probably first want to use Inspect Element to figure out what their tag names, classes, and IDs are.

* Every image on the page.
* The navigation area in the upper right.
* The sign-up button.
* The upper left-hand logo says **GDI** \(Hint: use CSS descendant selectors\).
* The **`href`** of the social media sources \(Twitter, Facebook, etc. at the bottom of the page\).
* The big heading that says "**WELCOME TO GIRL DEVELOP IT**".
* All of the images are in the **UPCOMING EVENTS**.
* BONUS: all the dots on the map.
