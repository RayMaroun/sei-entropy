# Lab: Change The Logo

## Change the Logo!

No homepage is safe from the logo bandit!

* Open up [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com) in Chrome, and open up the JavaScript console.
* Find the Google logo and store it in a variable.
* Save the current **`src`** attribute into a variable
* Modify the source of the logo IMG so that it's a Yahoo logo instead.
  * You can use this URL for the Yahoo Logo: `https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Yahoo%21_%282019%29.svg/1200px-Yahoo%21_%282019%29.svg.png`
  * **HINT**: You will need to figure out how to remove the **`srcset`** attribute!
* Find the **Google search** button and store it in a variable.
* Modify the text of the button so that it says "Yahooo!" instead.
  * **HINT**: You will need to figure out what to change.
