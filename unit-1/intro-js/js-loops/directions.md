### Print every number from 0 to 10

```text
//1, 2, 3, 4 etc.
```

### Print every number from 10 to 0

```text
//10, 9, 8, 7, 6 etc.
```

### Print every number from 4 to -16

```text
//4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2 etc.
```

### Print every fifth number from 8 to 41

```text
//8,  13, 18, etc.
```

## Exercises: JavaScript loops with array:

Open VS Code and complete these exercises

1.. Change all odd numbers to be those numbers multiplied by two:

```javascript
js const numbers = [4, 9, 7, 2, 1, 8];

numbers; // => [45, 18, 14, 2, 2, 8]
```

2. Create an array to hold your favorite colors. For each choice, log to the screen a string like `My #1 choice is blue.`

3. Create an array of ages. Loop through and log only the ages that are over 21.

4. Create an array to hold your toop five choices of something \(music, books, movies, whatever.\)

* For each choice, log to the screen a string like: `My #1 choice is blue.`
* **Bonus:**  Change it to log `My 1st choice, My 2nd choice, My 3rd choice` picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is.



### **The Classic FizzBuzz Program**

**For every number between 1 and 100...**

If the number is evenly divisible by 3, print "Fizz"

If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print "Buzz"

If the number is evenly divisible by 3 **AND** 5, print "FizzBuzz"

Else print just the regular  number



### **Multiplication Tables**

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result **\(e.g. 2 \* 9  = 18\)** .

**Bonus:** Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 \(100 results total\).

### The Grade Assigner

Check the results for every value from 60 to 100 - so your log should show **"For 89, you got a B. For 90, you got an A."**  **etc. etc.**
