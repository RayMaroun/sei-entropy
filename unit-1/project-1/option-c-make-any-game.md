# Option C: Make Any Game

## Make a game!

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

You have two options:

**Make any game you want!**

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

### Technical Requirements

## Any game you want!

If you are feeling creative and want to try something new, then go for it! In order to go this route you must run your idea by the instructional team first.

* your proposal must include: a summary of your idea, a wire frame \([this](https://wireframe.cc/) is a good site to make wireframes\), what you think the biggest challenges will be.
* Proposals are flexible! You are welcome to update and adjust these as the project continues.

### Other Game Ideas

### Beginner

* Simon
* War - Two Player
* Self-scoring Trivia
* Memory

### Medium

* Text Adventure
* Connect 4 - Two Player
* Sorry! - Multiple Players
* Checkers - Two Players
* Yahtzee - Two Players

### Advanced

* Battleship - Two Player
* Black Jack - with Computer AI
* Missile Command - Level Progression

### Necessary Deliverables

* Projects are due Thursday, 24/12/2020 at 9 am!
* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **landing page** with the name of your game, instructions and a start button
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repository
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning of the project_
* **A `README.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, any other useful information etc.

## 5 minute presentation

A **2 minute demo of your game**: Show us the functionality!

Some questions might help you with the presentation:

* What is the game about?
* Is there any information you think might help us understand what you built?
* What features did you include?
  * Make sure to explain anything "new" \(things that we didn't cover in class\)
* What was the most difficult part of the project?
* What was your favourate part to work on?
* What would you like to add next?

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** \(data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation\) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Developer Tools** \(`console.log`, inspector, `alert` statements, etc\) to debug and solve problems
  * Some great tutorials for the Developer Tools can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
* Work through the lessons in class, **ask questions and come to office hours** when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your Tic Tac Toe game each day, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Check out Tutorial and Documentation resources** at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements \(buttons, links, etc\) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

## README Suggestions

* List technologies used
* Link to wireframes and user stories.
* Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
* List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
* Describe how some of your favorite functions work
