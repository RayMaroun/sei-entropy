### Q3: Fibonacci

For this function, the first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1.

```javascript
function fibonacci(){
    
}
```

### Q4: Coin Flips

This function returns an array of all possible outcomes from flipping a coin N times. The input type is an Integer.

For example, `coinFlips(2`\) would return the following:  
`["HH", "HT", "TH", "TT"]`  
H stands for Heads and T stands for tails  
Represent the two outcomes of each flip as "H" or "T"

```javascript
function coinFlips(){

}
```
