## Project \#2: React List App

### Overview:

You will be making a Single Page Application \(SPA\)  that is a list of any type of items.

**You will be working individually on this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

### What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground  and reviewed, many of the big themes of the course so far:

* **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
* **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
* **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with objects, arrays, events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
* **Web Fundamentals**: Learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JS to build interactive web pages. Also, learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
* **Browser Applications**: Dive into JavaScript, and figure out how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style and functionality for free.
* **Responsive Web Design**: Making web applications that respond to device size.
* **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment.
* **AJAX**: Using Axios to make asynchronous JavaScript calls.
* **React**: A front end framework for building modern web applications.

### Requirements

#### General

* **Build a web application from scratch**, without a starter codebase.  Must be your own work.
* **Use React with `create-react-app`** to build your application.
* Plan your application using **wireframes** and **user stories**.
* **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app** to the world.
* **Deploy your app online**, where the rest of the world can access it.

#### Technical

Select a Project Idea of your own. But the user must be able to:

* Add a new item to a list
* Edit an item from a list
* Remove an item from a list
* Clear/delete all items or Clear/delete only marked items
* Mark the item as complete/favorite/\(watch, read, listen\) later/flag/etc
* Fetch data from at least one 3rd party API using Axios or `fetch`
* Make frequent Git commits with descriptive messages, explaining your commit

#### Stretch Goals

* Make the app Responsive
* Save the data to `localStorage` or an API
* Use 1 or more 3rd party API's with Axios or `fetch`.
* Use 1 or more 3rd party libraries
* Use a React component library like [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce), [Bootstrap React](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), or [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* Use a CSS library like [Bootstrap \(tutorial\)](https://m.pardel.net/react-and-bootstrap-4-part-1-setup-navigation-d4767e2ed9f0)
* Add User Sign Up, Sign In, and Sign Out with [Firebase and React Authentication \(tutorial\)](https://medium.com/firebase-developers/how-to-setup-firebase-authentication-with-react-in-5-minutes-maybe-10-bb8bb53e8834), alternative tutorial [here](https://css-tricks.com/firebase-react-part-2-user-authentication/) \(can be very challenging\).

### README Suggestions

* List technologies used
* Link to wireframes and user stories.
* Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
* List unsolved problems which that would be fixed in future iterations.
* Describe how some of your favorite functionality works.

### Necessary Deliverables

Projects are due on **Wed 13/1 at 11 PM** or **Thu 14/1 at 9 AM** max!

Submissions will be submitted by posting into Google Sheet

* a link to your deployed application 
* a link to your GitHub repository

The presentation must be a **5-minute presentation** in which you answer the following questions:

* What is the application about?
* What are the user stories for your application?
* Is there any information you think might help us understand what you built?
* What features did you include?
  * Make sure to explain anything "new" \(things that we didn't cover in class\)
* What API did you choose to use?
* Demo of the application
* Walkthrough a piece of code
* What was the most difficult part of the project?
* What was your favorite part of the project?
* What would you like to add next?
