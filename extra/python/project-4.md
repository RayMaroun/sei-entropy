# Project 4

## Project 4 Overview

**The time has come for the final project.** Ideally, this project should incorporate some framework/technology we haven't covered, but feel free to use anything we have learned in the course as well.

Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor so you can make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that'll showcase your skills both visually and functionally**. Sometimes people do judge a book by its cover – or in this case, an app by its design.

## Technical Requirements

Your app must \(unless otherwise approved\):

* **Use Django or Express/ React** to build an application frontend and backend
  * Other frameworks and languages will be considered on a case-by-case basis
* **Create an application using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
* Include **all major CRUD functions** for at least one of your models
  * At least one PUT
  * At least one DELETE
  * At least one POST
  * At least 2 GETs
* Create your own front-end! **Put effort into your design!**
  * If you have a friend in UX, feel free to consult with them or have them help you with non-code aspects of the project \(such as wireframing, color palette, etc\). After all, this is a portfolio piece - put your best work forward!
* Add authentication \(login\) **AND authorization** \(page protection\) to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard Git flow on Github
* Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**, with or without a framework.
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible

## Project Planning Deliverables <a id="necessary-deliverables"></a>

####  **You should review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code.**

* **Scope:** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **User Stories:** Who is your user? What features will your app have? Set up your project and user stories in [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Asana](https://asana.com/).
* **Wireframes:** Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a _paper prototype_ to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
* **Data Models:** Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity-relationship diagram \(ERD\).
* **Milestones:** Divide your work into parts - the most essential features for your MVP, features that are important but not essential, and features that can be saved for a later iteration. Create 3-5 major milestones with dates outlining when you expect essential features will be done.
* **Feasibility Study:** If you're using an external API or scraping a website, make sure you can get that data. If you're using a new language, framework, or tool, go through its getting started tutorial. We _will_ ask to see your results.

## Completed Project Deliverables <a id="necessary-deliverables"></a>

* A **working app** hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A** **`readme.md`** **file** with:
  * An embedded screenshot of the app
  * Explanations of the **technologies** used
  * A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
  * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
  * Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
  * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views/interfaces in your application
  * Link to your **pitch deck** – documentation of your wireframes, user stories, and proposed architecture
  * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome



## Stretch Goals

* Use a React component library like [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce), [Bootstrap React](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), or [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* Use a CSS framework like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
* Allow user to change website theme, Dark mode, etc.
* Include Pagination.
* Utilize 3rd party APIs.
* Sent verification email upon registration.
* Allow the user to reset the password if the user can't log in.
* Allow the user to upload image files.
* Add the ability to chat between users.
* Utilize a text API like [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)

## Suggested Ways to Get Started <a id="suggested-ways-to-get-started"></a>

* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies/frameworks/API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
