# Django Installation

## MacOS Installation



At this point we should all have Python3 and pip installed and working. Installing Django will only be a two step process for Mac.

```text
// This installs Django web development framework

pip3 install Django
```

And that's it!

## Windows Installation

We will go through this live because so many people have Windows in our course. But the installation will go as follows to start.

```text
pip3 install Django
```
