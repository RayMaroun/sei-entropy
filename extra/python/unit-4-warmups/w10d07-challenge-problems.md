## Problem 1 - Power of Two



Complete the below function, `power_of_two` , that determines if a given non-negative integer is a power of two. 

```python
## "a power of two is a number of the form 2n where n is an integer, 
## i.e. the result of exponentiation with number two as the base and 
## integer n as the exponent."

def power_of_two(x):
  # your code here
  
power_of_two(1024) ==> True
power_of_two(4096) ==> True
power_of_two(333)  ==> False
```

## Problem 2 - Square Every Digit

In this problem, we want you to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example:

```python
square_digits(9119) =>> returns 811181
## 9 squared ==> 81, 1 squared ==> 1
## Concatenated together, we get ==> 811181

def square_digits(num):
    # your code here

```

 **Note:** The function accepts an integer and returns an integer



## For the first warmup be sure to use floor division or "//", for the second warmup be sure to use power operator or "\*\*".
